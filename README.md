# mobilemoneyETH
Hey there! I am surprised people still read these things. Thank you for downloading my first coding project as a novice programmer. My first project will IDEALLY allow the user to store, receive, and spend fiat or ETH. I encounter the following problems when I press play in my project (copied from the Output section of Visual Studio Code)

[Running] python -u "...pythonmobilemoney\main.py"
  File "... pythonmobilemoney\main.py", line 14
    print("Amount", amount,"deposited succesfully new balance is : ", new_balance")
                                                                                 ^
SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 14)

[Done] exited with code=1 in 0.2 seconds

In the Problems section of VSC, it states:

[{
	"resource": "...pythonmobilemoney/main.py",
	"owner": "_generated_diagnostic_collection_name_#2",
	"severity": 8,
	"message": "\"(\" was not closed",
	"source": "Pylance",
	"startLineNumber": 14,
	"startColumn": 8,
	"endLineNumber": 14,
	"endColumn": 9
}]

I stared at this code until I was blue in the face. I need guidance if ya'll dont mind. It is based off this Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbrv8EeMkI

Please help! Thanks.
